## Modules Overview

### `data_ingestion.py`

- **Purpose**: Handles the collection and loading of raw data from various sources.
- **Functionality**:
  - Reading data from files or databases.
  - Performing initial data validation checks.
  - Splitting data into training and testing sets.

### `data_transformation.py`

- **Purpose**: Processes and transforms raw data into a suitable format for model training.
- **Functionality**:
  - Cleaning data (handling missing values, removing duplicates).
  - Feature engineering (encoding categorical variables, feature scaling).
  - Saving transformed data for modeling.

### `model_trainer.py`

- **Purpose**: Trains machine learning models using the processed data.
- **Functionality**:
  - Selecting and configuring machine learning algorithms.
  - Training models on the training dataset.
  - Evaluating models using the testing dataset.
  - Saving the best-performing model for deployment.

### `pipeline/predict_pipeline.py`

- **Purpose**: Utilizes the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen data.
- **Functionality**:
  - Loading the saved model.
  - Preparing new data for prediction (applying same transformations as training data).
  - Generating and outputting predictions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries listed in `requirements.txt` (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Pipeline

1. **Data Ingestion**:

   ```bash
   python data_ingestion.py
   ```

2. **Data Transformation**:

   ```bash
   python data_transformation.py
   ```

3. **Model Training**:

   ```bash
   python model_trainer.py
   ```

4. **Making Predictions**:

   ```bash
   python pipeline/predict_pipeline.py
   ```

## Notes

- The `__init__.py` files indicate that the directories are Python packages, allowing for modular imports.
- Customize each module according to your specific data and model requirements.
- Ensure that the same data transformations applied during training are applied in the prediction pipeline to maintain consistency.
